    "text": "I am a physics PhD student at Duke University studying quantum algorithms and quantum computing. I am interested in developing quantum computers and algorithms that can solve useful and interesting problems that are intractable for classical computers.   When not doing something that involves quantum, I enjoy rock climbing, calisthenics, and doing strenuous physical activities. To that end, I recently broke the Guinness World Record for the most number of muscle ups done in 24 hours."
